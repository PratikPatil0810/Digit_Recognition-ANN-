# Digit_Recognition-ANN-
Created a model that recognizes handwritten digits using artificial neural networks.

A simple and effective Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model built to classify handwritten digits (0–9) using the MNIST dataset. The project demonstrates the complete workflow of a supervised deep-learning classification task — including dataset preprocessing, model building, training, evaluation, and prediction.
